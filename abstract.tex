A large body of recent work has proposed analytical and empirical
techniques for quantifying the consistency properties of distributed
data stores. In this demonstration, we begin to explore the wide range
of new database functionality they enable, including dynamic query
tuning, consistency SLAs, monitoring, and administration. Our
demonstration will exhibit how both application programmers and
database administrators can leverage these features.  We describe
three major application scenarios and present a system architecture to
support them. We also describe our experience in integrating
Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) predictions into Cassandra,
a popular NoSQL store and sketch a demonstration that will allow
SIGMOD attendees to experience the importance and applicability of
real-time consistency metrics.
